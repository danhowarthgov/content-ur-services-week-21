# Content design and user research meetup – Services Week 2021
Resources from the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/content-design-and-user-research-meetup-services-week-2021-tickets-142131482089">content design and user research meetup at Services Week 2021</a>. Including slides, links and contact details.

## Notes from the interactive parts

We used Mentimeter and Teams to run the session. Mentimeter lets you ask questions, do polls and get feedback from the audience. During each lightning talk, we asked for people’s thoughts and ideas, then spent 5 minutes discussing them after each talk. We also used Mentimeter for an ice-breaker at the beginning, and a retro at the end. We exported all the Mentimeter slides and feedback to PDF (although it's not accessible. We'll work on that).

### Damien Middleditch: doing content crits

Damien is head of content design at HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), part of the UK government. Damien’s lightning talk was on content crits and how to do them. He showed a design crit structure that was created by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ).

Damien recommends that you read:
* Jane McFadyen’s blog post, ‘<a href="https://gathercontent.com/blog/why-you-should-run-content-crits-and-how-they-improve-ux-design">Why you should run content crits and how they improve UX design</a>’, for GatherContent


## Content crit of a research participant consent form

Following Damien’s talk on how to do a content crit, Lucy Sutton (ResearchOps at DfE) offered a new user research participant consent form she’s working on at DfE for us to crit. Dom and Dan led the crit, and they fielded comments and suggestions from the audience via Mentimeter and Miro. Because the crit is a safe environment and sometimes contains sensitive information, we’re not going to post the outputs here. But we are thinking about how to summarise it, and we’ll update this page when we do.
